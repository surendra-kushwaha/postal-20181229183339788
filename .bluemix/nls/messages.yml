template.name: "Create toolchain: Postal App for IBM Blockchain"
template.description: "\n This toolchain will deploy a Postal application application against a IBM Blockchain Platform network. \n\n The toolchain starts by creating your own repository of the Posatl code. This repo is connected to a Delivery Pipeline which means if you update the code in your GitHub repo, the Deployment Pipeline will detect it and deploy your changes. The toolchain also creates a **new Blockchain Platform service instance**, which is your blockchain network.\n\n **You do not need to change any of the options on the right**, though you may tweak configurations if you need to. \n\nYou may need to authorize IBM Cloud with your GitHub account before you can create the toolchain."
